    "In this lecture, we will explore how to control workflow in a code using conditionals and loops. For more information, we recommend reviewing some of the online documentation available at https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/controlflow.html. We will also see how to make code more modular by creating user defined functions. \n",

    "### Conditionals in Python    \n",
    "0. In Python, there are no \"case\" or \"switch\" options that are available in other languages, but we can get the same functionality by using dictionary mappings. However, this is beyond the scope of this tutorial. \n",
    "1. You will find that most things can be done using the if/elif/else syntax:\n",
    "```\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    #do stuff\n",
    "elif condition:\n",
    "    #do stuff\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    #do stuff\n",
    "```       \n",
    "\n",
    "***All parts of the conditional are indented.*** Unlike other languages that use terms like \"end\" or \"end if\" (or perhaps make use of brackets like \"{ }\") to signify the block of code corresponding to an if-elseif-else, Python interprets everything in terms of indenting. This is also true in for-loops as we will see below.\n",
    "       \n",
    "### Comparison operators  (*LET a=3, b=5*)\n",
    "==:\tIf the values of two operands are equal, then the condition becomes true.\t*(a == b) is not true.*\n",
    "\n",
    "!=:\tIf values of two operands are not equal, then condition becomes true.  *(a != b) is true.* (Alternatively, one could use `<>` in place of `!=`, but this is not very common.)\n",
    "\n",
    " \">\":\tIf the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.\t*(a > b) is not true.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\"<\": If the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.\t*(a < b) is true.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\">=\":\tIf the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.\t*(a >= b) is not true.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\"<=\":\tIf the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.\t*(a <= b) is true.*\n",
    "\n",
    "We can us **and** and **or** to combine sets of comparison operators and **not** to negate a statement. \n",

    "Try changing different values of `x` in the code snippets below and see what happens."

    "## Functions in Python \n",
    "In the code snippets above, a value of `x` serves as the input into a conditional statement that determines what output value `f` should be assigned based on the value of `x`. If we wish to use this functionality many times in the code, we would probably like to avoid writing the if/elif/else structure at each point where it is to be used for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, the following:\n",
    "- If we ever decide to change how `f` is computed, then we would have to find/replace every instance of it within the code.\n",
    "- Even the most terse scientific code can easily become hundreds if not thousands of lines long, and we want to avoid making the code more difficult to read, use, and debug than is absolutely necessary. \n",

    "### A brief discussion on docstrings and commenting in code\n",
    "The (triple) quotes is where you put in a documentation string for your function.  It is entirely optional, but it is always a good idea to document your code even when it is entirely in the developmental/testing phase. There are some best practices that you can read about at https://docs.python.org/devguide/documenting.html or http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/documentation/. \n",
    "\n",
    "Good tools such as Sphinx http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/1.4.8/ can turn properly documented code into easy to read/navigate html files to help expand the community of users for any code you develop. For example, see http://ut-chg.github.io/BET/ where Sphinx was used to generate the documentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "### parameters and keyword arguments in a function\n",
    "Notice that in the definition of the function, there is a `parameters` variable, which is often a list of parameters (as shown below). These are normally ordered **UNLESS** you supplement them with *keyword args* in the function call (i.e., when you actually use the function you may specify which argument corresponds to which parameter).  The next two code snippet illustrates this."

    "Troy to-do: discretize heat equation using explicit time stepping. Describe process with some pictures and basic Centered Finite Difference scheme along with Neumann BC. Setup a \"fill-in-the-blank\" code snippets with a function that gets an index of an array and determines what the value of the stiffness matrix should be through if-elif-else conditional. Then nested-loop through the indices. This is intended to be functional and for pedagogical purposes only, not efficient. Then, use a while loop to walk through the time steps where students can change the time-step but it is truncated at the final time if the time-step does not evenly divide into $t_f$. Plot vs the exact solution from previous lecture."
